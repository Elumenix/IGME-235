<h1>Adaptive Layout</h1>
    <img src="media/smallLayout.PNG" alt="">
    <p>I still wan't the layout to look unique so I'm keeping two columns (which from what i've seen is unusual on mobile) and I'm keeping and reorganizing a few of the jutting edges. A few text blocks and images will be removed to keep the content more concise and spare me the effort of trying to adapt things that will never fit on a smaller resolution or break down as a result of the current grid layout.</p>

    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>All svg images on this site came from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a></p>
    <p>All other concept images came from <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pabGn0Y4v0q-2MDJQBcVwfQgLfHQlaObEu7vClT34hU/edit#slide=id.p">this</a> slideshow. These are all AI generated images that were created for our project, which is great because it currently makes them legally ambiguous. I used a second AI to increase the aspect resolution and refine the detail on the images so that they could fit on a larger screen size with high quality.</p>
    
    <h1>Goal</h1>
    <p>The goal was to create a moodboard that would look attractive as a part of project documentation to employers. That's mainly the reason I chose this layout; it offered an appealing design with clear space to add images and text. As long as ideas are portrayed seperatly and in an interesting way I think that this will be fine, so my layout hasn't needed to deviate too much from the specification.</p>
    
    <h1> Notes:</h1>
    <p> 
        The first thing that became apparent was that all the grid elements are spaced unevenly and almost never line up with any other grid elements. The entire thing looks wrong even when sligtly off, so I ended up opening the pdf in gimp and had to pixel measure the height and width of each element and apply them to the css file, which was a very tedious and time consuming process. I also needed them to stay within the page so I of course had to calculate them as percentages of the viewport size. Because all grid elements have to be handeled individually, my css file is much longer than I would like it to be, though there may exist a few ways to shorten it with shortened properties once I learn more about them.

        The second grid became challenging becasue of the whitespace that was expected to be between each line. I originally used the 
        shortened border property to apply a 6px white border to all divs within the grid. This made it almost perfect, but it made the it so that the sides of the grid had whitespace, so it didn't line up with the grid above it. There was also a problem with the div in the center that overlapped with two of the above elements. The whitespace above it could never line up because it's borders didn't actually touch the divs above it, and extending those borders caused the div space to shrink, which caused it to no longer line up with the divs below it. The only real solution was to give all divs surrounding it specialized whitespace values, which had to be calculated individually, so I ended up applying all whitespace manually instead of using a group selector. The final div at the bottom didn't really have to be a part of the grid, but it simplified the resizing that needed to be done to make it align with other elements.

    <p>I still need to change my color palatte and come up with better alt tags. I didn't have enough time to properly address those things in phase 1</p>
