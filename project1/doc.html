    <h1> Notes:</h1>

        The first thing that became apparent was that all the grid elements are spaced unevenly and almost never line up with any other grid elements. The entire thing looks wrong even when sligtly off, so I ended up opening the pdf in gimp and had to pixel measure the height and width of each element and apply them to the css file, which was a very tedious and time consuming process. I also needed them to stay within the page so I of course had to calculate them as percentages of the viewport size. Because all grid elements have to be handeled individually, my css file is much longer than I would like it to be, though there may exist a few ways to shorten it with shortened properties once I learn more about them.

        The second grid became challenging becasue of the whitespace that was expected to be between each line. I originally used the 
        shortened border property to apply a 6px white border to all divs within the grid. This made it almost perfect, but it made the it so that the sides of the grid had whitespace, so it didn't line up with the grid above it. There was also a problem with the div in the center that overlapped with two of the above elements. The whitespace above it could never line up because it's borders didn't actually touch the divs above it, and extending those borders caused the div space to shrink, which caused it to no longer line up with the divs below it. The only real solution was to give all divs surrounding it specialized whitespace values, which had to be calculated individually, so I ended up applying all whitespace manually instead of using a group selector. The final div at the bottom didn't really have to be a part of the grid, but it simplified the resizing that needed to be done to make it align with other elements.
