    <h1>Proposal</h1>
<p>I intend to make a top-down, 2D, arcade-style racing game in PixiJS. I don't think the physics of it will be too dificult and it seems realistically doable within the time frame. <br>Stretch goals would be randomly generated tracks and particle effects that would aid game feel, such as skid marks.</p>
