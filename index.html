                About Me 
            </h2>

            <p>
                I'm Donovan Scullion, a second year Game Design & Development Major here at RIT. My main hobby is gaming (I know, a shocker), and I prodominantly play indie and Nintendo games. My main interests in the games industry is in artificial intelligence and level design. In this class, I hope to learn the skills to make my own portfolio and potentially look into back-end development. At RIT, I hope to further develop my programming abilities and, if lucky, get a job right out of college.
            </p>
