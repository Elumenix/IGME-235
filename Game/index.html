                <p>
                <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
                Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around. 
                The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
